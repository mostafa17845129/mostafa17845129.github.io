The first title of the series was Age of Empires, released in 1997. Seven titles and three spin-offs have been released.

The sequel, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, was set in the Middle Ages, while its expansion focused partially on the Spanish conquest of Mexico. The subsequent three games of Age of Empires III explored the early modern period, when Europe was colonizing the Americas and several Asian nations were on the decline. The newest installment, Age of Empires Online, takes a different approach as a free-to-play online game utilizing Games for Windows Live. A spin-off game, Age of Mythology, was set in the same period as the original Age of Empires, but focused on mythological elements of Greek, Egyptian, and Norse mythology. A fourth main installment in the series, Age of Empires IV, is under development.

Critics have credited part of the success of the series to its historical theme and fair play; the artificial intelligence (AI) players fight with fewer advantages than in many of the series' competitors.</strong></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><a href="https://www.downloadha.com/game/age-of-empires-definitive-edition/" target="_blank">Download Age of Empires</a></span></p></blockquote>

                <blockquote><strong>Story
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>The game follows the protagonist Chuchel, a dust bunny-like creature, as he tries to retrieve a cherry stolen by a giant one early morning, with his all-in-one best friend, enemy and pet Kekel either helping or hindering him on the way. The game is structured into short, loosely connected episodes of Chuchel's struggles to retrieve and keep the cherry; the episodic nature is emphasized by some levels showing the title.
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>In last level, it is revealed that the giant hand teasing Chuchel with the cherry is in fact a larger Chuchel-like creature; it swallows Chuchel and Kekel who retrieve the cherry from its stomach, and climb up to its brain to switch it from "grumpy" to "happy". The now-happy giant then delivers Chuchel and Kekel back to their home, where they finally split and eat the cherry, only to get a huge pile more brought by the giant, who then starts chasing a large pear carried by an even larger hand.
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Gameplay
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>The game consists of 30 levels. The player controls eponymous Chuchel whose task is to retrieve a Cherry. Levels are different and most of them are played as Point &amp; click adventure but some consist of minigames including spoofs of Pac-Man, Flappy Bird, Tetris, Space Invaders and the T-Rex Chrome Offline Game. When Chuchel retrieves the Cherry, antagonist Chuchel shows up and steals it. Chuchel is aided by his pet Kekel who helps him to get the Cherry.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Development
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>The game was developed by Amanita Design. Designer Jaromír Plachý started to work on the game after he finished Botanicula in 2012. Plachý stated that he wanted to make an interactive cartoon with funny animation. He came up with the character of Chuchel (meaning a hairy bunch in Czech) when he decided to draw the first thing that comes to his mind. Plachý then designed environments and turned them into actual levels.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>The game won the award for Excellence in Visual Art at the Independent Games Festival.</strong></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><a href="https://www.downloadha.com/game/chuchel/" target="_blank">Download Chuchel</a></span></p></blockquote>

Kicking off with the world exclusive trailer approach, the studio's executive producer Burkhard Ratheiser and community developer Bastian Thun explained how deeply the game is informed by the series' dedicated community, why this is such a rich setting for the game (two industrial revolutions!) and what that means for the latest entry.

At the time, the possibility of Xenonauts 2 becoming their next project was still under evaluation.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>The game is being developed using the Unity game engine. It will make use of 3D graphics rather than the 2D sprites of its predecessor.The development team's main concern with the transition to 3D graphics was whether they could create an art style that looked good and replicated the sprites from the original game. The use of 3D graphics would enable features such as objects with physics behaviour and rotating the camera angle.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Setting the game in an alternate timeline meant that humanity would not possess the advanced alien technology from Xenonauts. The developers believed that this decision gave them the freedom to alter the story, setting and enemies to craft a more interesting game. They also set out to redesign the aliens for the sequel. Project lead, Chris England remarked that he wanted them to be both visually and mechanically more interesting than in Xenonauts.</strong></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><a href="http://p30download.com/fa/entry/53242/" target="_blank">Download Xenonauts 2</a></span></p></blockquote>
